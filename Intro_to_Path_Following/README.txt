In this project, the MATLAB code in Path_following_basic version 1 (v1) and 2 (v2) uses state machine logic from the waypoint following project to follow points specified by the user.

A new state machine is implemented to make the UAV follow these specified points. In version 1 of the project, the UAV performs maneuvers that resemble basic shapes. In version 2, the UAV performs maneuvers that result in a flight path that looks like a stick figure.

All the waypoints are included in the state machine in each MATLAB file.
