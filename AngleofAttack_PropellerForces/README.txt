The parameters to import file contains constants and coefficnets for a test aircraft.

The program calculates the longitudinal forces as a function of alpha, Va, delta_r, delta_a, p, and r. The output is fx, fz, and m.

The program also calculates the lateral forces as a function of beta, Va, delta_r, delta_a, p, and r. The output is fy, l, and n.

The program includes a function that determines the propeller thrust and torque.

The program also accounts for gravity. The final output is fx, fy, fz, l, m, and n.

The test cases display different values of alpha (angle of attack) to show how the forces change on the aircraft and how torque and moment are measured on the propeller.
