This MATLAB script applies a standard 3x3 Gaussian filter on an image's RGB channels independently. The MATLAB script uses the image processing toolbox and the imread function in the module. The Gaussian kernel is the following:

1, 2, 1; 2, 4, 2; 1, 2, 1

The weight of the kernel multiplier is 1/16.
